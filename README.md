# Wedding Landing Page

Simple static landing page for a wedding invitation (Save the Date, religious event, party, recommended hotel).

How to use

- Open [index.html](/workspace/index.html) in your browser.
- Edit `index.html` to replace names, dates, addresses, and the RSVP email.

Files

- [index.html](/workspace/index.html) — main page
- [styles.css](/workspace/styles.css) — styling

Next steps (suggested)

- Replace placeholder addresses and links with real locations and booking links.
- Hook the RSVP link to a real form (Google Forms, Typeform, or a small server endpoint).
- Host on GitHub Pages, Netlify, or any static web host.
